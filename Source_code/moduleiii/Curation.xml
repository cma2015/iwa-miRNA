.. class:: donemark

**What it does**

This tool generates detailed summary and report pages for miRNA refinement during manual inspection.

.. class:: infomark

**Inputs**

- **Selected miRNAs from miRNASelection:** miRNA table from **miRNASelection**, which includes classification results based on high-throughput (HT) criteria and/or machine learning (ML)-based approaches;
- **Sample information:** Tissue information as following examples:
	
    | SRR11829907	inflorescence
    | SRR11347201	leaf
    | ......

- **Genome annotation file** with following information in tab delimited format. Genome annotations will be used to label the source of miRNAs. 

	.. image:: static/assets/html/_images/GenomeAnnotation.png
		:scale: 60 %
		:align: center

    | PCG: protein coding gene; ncRNA_gene: non-protein coding RNA gene; TE: Transposable element.
    | lncRNA: long non-coding RNA; LTR: long terminal repeat; RC: Rolling-circle.

- **Gene descriptions:** Gene descriptions as following examples:
       
    | AT1G18630	GR-RBP6
    | AT4G25980	Peroxidase 43
    | AT5G04040	SDP1
    | AT4G27920	RCAR4
    | AT4G27980	Domain of unknown function (DUF3444)
    | AT3G14150	HAOX2
    | AT5G45750	RABA1c
    | ......

.. class:: infomark

**Outputs**

- **The interactive annotation HTML of promising miRNA candidates**: The summary and report pages containing information of miRNA precursors and mature miRNAs. The meaning of each column in the file is as follows:

    - **ID**: The modified name of miRNA precursors. miRNAs from databases remain their raw names and miRNAs from sRNA-Seq got a new name with species-MIR-N{number}{letter};

    - **HT criteria**: The true/false means whether miRNAs meet the High-throughput (HT) criteria or not.

    - **One class SVM**: miRNA categories defined according to the predictions of one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is trained using miRNAs in the positive dataset. "remained_positive": miRNAs in the positive dataset are predicted as miRNAs. "removed_positive": miRNAs in the positive dataset are not predicted as miRNAs. "novel_prediction": miRNA candidates are predicted as miRNAs, and "others": miRNA candidates are not predicted as miRNAs.

    - **Genomic source**: Genomic sources of miRNAs.

    - **Source**: "1", "2", "3", "4" represent annotated miRNAs from miRBase, PmiREN, sRNAanno and Psgenes databases, respectively. "p" denotes miRNAs predicted by ``miRNAPredict`` function in iwa-miRNA.

    - **Stem loop**: **Loc, Len, MFE, AMFE** - The location, length, minimum free energy (MFE), adjusted MFE of stem-loop sequence;

    - **Mature miRNA**: **Arm, Seq, Len, TPM** - The arm, sequence (5'->3'), length, abundance of mature miRNAs;

    - **miRNA precursor**: **Seq count** - Number of collapsed reads mapped to miRNA precursors; **Abundance bias**: The sum of the TPM of miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) was divided by the TPM of miRNA precursors; **Strand bias** - The sum of the TPM of sequences matching miRNA precursors was divided by that matching both strands; **RNAfold** - Whether miRNAs have an effective RNA structure predicted by RNAfold. The miRNA/miRNA* duplexes with up to five mismatched positions (including up to three nucleotides in asymmetric bulges) are considered to have an effective RNA structure; **Centroidfold** - Whether miRNAs have an effective RNA structure predicted by Centroidfold. The miRNA/miRNA* duplexes with up to five mismatched positions (including up to three nucleotides in asymmetric bulges) are considered to have an effective RNA structure;

    - **Expressed samples**: **Mean** - The average TPM of one miRNA across all sRNA-Seq datasets; **Max** - The max TPM of one miRNA across all sRNA-Seq datasets; **Samples (TPM>1)** - The number of samples with TPMâ‰¥1.
