==========================================

Download test data
------------------

Test data for iwa-miRNA are both available at |GitHub_data| and |Web_server_data|.

-  For |GitHub_data|, click "**Clone**" (see the figure below), and then download the ZIP compressed file into your local device, and then unzip the file.

Data descriptions
---------------------

A brief description of test data files:

**sRNA-Seq_test_data.zip**

This file contains raw sequencing reads in FASTQ format, which can be uploaded to iwa-miRNA server and used as inputs of ``miRNAPredict`` module. In detail, two Arabidopsis sRNA-Seq data (SRR11347201 and SRR11829907) were selected, and the first 10 million rows were packaged and named as test1.fastq.gz and test2.fastq.gz.

**sample_information.txt**

This file contains the tissue name of corresponding samples involved in **sRNA-Seq_test_data**. It has two columns with **tab-delimited format**. The first column is **sample names**, and the second column is **tissue names**.

**gene_description.txt**

This file contains genes descriptions and is used as input of ``manualCuration`` function. It has two columns with **tab-delimited format**. The first column is the gene names and the second column is the gene description. Gene descriptions were extracted from |Arabidopsis GFF3 annotation file|.

**genome_annotation.txt**

This file contains gene function annotation information, which can be uploaded to iwa-miRNA server and used as inputs of the ``manualCuration`` and ``associationAnalysis`` modules. It has seven columns with **tab-delimited format**, which represent **chromosomes, start sites, end sites, ID, strand, gene types, and detailed types**. These gene attributes were extracted from |Arabidopsis GFF3 annotation file|. TEs (Transposed elements) were downloaded from |TAIR10_Transposable_Elements|.

**SNPs_in_Arabidopsis.txt**

This file contains part of SNPs from *The 1001 Genomes Project* and is used as input of the ``sequenceVariation`` function. It has five columns with **tab-delimited format**, representing **chromosomes, start sites, ID, reference, and alternative alleles**, respectively. This information can be downloaded from |Ensembl Plants Variations|.
