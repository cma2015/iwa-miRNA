Manual Curation
===============

This module provides the information for all miRNA candidates generated during the compilation and selection processes, and creates a summary page for rapid curation of the quality of selected miRNAs.

Input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Selected miRNAs from miRNASelection**: miRNA table from ``miRNASelection``, which includes classification results based on high-throughput (HT) criteria and/or machine learning (ML)-based approaches.
- **Sample information**: upload tissue information to iwa-miRNA server as following example (Arabidopsis: ``sample_information.txt``):

    .. figure:: img/Sample_information.png
       :alt: 

- **Genome annotation file**: Genome annotations will be used to label the source of miRNAs. We provided Arabidopsis data ``genome_annotation.txt`` with following format:

    .. figure:: img/Genome_annotation.png
       :alt: 

    **Note**:  

    + **PCG** - protein coding gene; **ncRNA_gene**: non-protein coding RNA gene; **TE**: Transposable element.

    + **lncRNA**: long non-coding RNA; **LTR**: long terminal repeat; **RC**: Rolling-circle.

- (Optional) **Gene description file**: Gene descriptions as following example (Arabidopsis: ``gene_description.txt``):

    .. figure:: img/Gene_description.png
       :alt: 

**Note**: If you are not clear about how to upload local data to iwa-miRNA server, please see ``Upload data to your local iwa-miRNA server`` for details.

Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **The interactive annotation HTML of promising miRNA candidates**: The summary and report pages containing information of miRNA precursors and mature miRNAs.

How to use this function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    For selections, please see the following figure:

    **I)** The summary and report pages containing the information of miRNA precursors and mature miRNAs will be returned (see the figure below). Users can make a further decision based on their knowledge through flexible operations, such as adjusting thresholds of filters, and selecting and deleting miRNA candidates. The complete preview of the results is available at |Output in manualCuration|.

    **Note**: Users can update the list of selected miRNAs in a dynamic manner through adjusting criteria thresholds, or by direct deletion from the summary page. The meaning of each column in the file is as follows:

        + **ID**: The modified name of miRNA precursors. miRNAs from databases remain their raw names and miRNAs from sRNA-Seq got a new name with species-MIR-N{number}{letter};

        + **HT criteria**: The true/false means whether miRNAs meet the High-throughput (HT) criteria or not.

        + **One class SVM**: miRNA categories defined according to the predictions of one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is trained using miRNAs in the positive dataset. "remained_positive": miRNAs in the positive dataset are predicted as miRNAs. "removed_positive": miRNAs in the positive dataset are not predicted as miRNAs. "novel_prediction": miRNA candidates are predicted as miRNAs, and "others": miRNA candidates are not predicted as miRNAs.

        + **Genomic source**: Genomic sources of miRNAs.

        + **Source**: "1", "2", "3", "4" represent annotated miRNAs from miRBase, PmiREN, sRNAanno and Psgenes databases, respectively. "p" denotes miRNAs predicted by ``miRNAPredict`` function in iwa-miRNA.

        + **Stem loop**: **Loc, Len, MFE, AMFE** - The location, length, minimum free energy (MFE), adjusted MFE of stem-loop sequence;

        + **Mature miRNA**: **Arm, Seq, Len, TPM** - The arm, sequence (5'->3'), length, abundance of mature miRNAs;

        + **miRNA precursor**: **Seq count** - Number of collapsed reads mapped to miRNA precursors; **Abundance bias**: The sum of the TPM of miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) was divided by the TPM of miRNA precursors; **Strand bias** - The sum of the TPM of sequences matching miRNA precursors was divided by that matching both strands; **RNAfold** - Whether miRNAs have an effective RNA structure predicted by RNAfold. The miRNA/miRNA* duplexes with up to five mismatched positions (including up to three nucleotides in asymmetric bulges) are considered to have an effective RNA structure; **Centroidfold** - Whether miRNAs have an effective RNA structure predicted by Centroidfold. The miRNA/miRNA* duplexes with up to five mismatched positions (including up to three nucleotides in asymmetric bulges) are considered to have an effective RNA structure;

        + **Expressed samples**: **Mean** - The average TPM of one miRNA across all sRNA-Seq datasets; **Max** - The max TPM of one miRNA across all sRNA-Seq datasets; **Samples (TPM>1)** - The number of samples with TPMâ‰¥1.

    **II)** Each miRNA has a **report page** that contains detailed information customized by feature types, making it easy to understand this miRNA during manual curation.

       :alt: 

    **Note**: **A secondary structure plot** is generated to display the location of a mature miRNA within the precursor sequence and quality-profiling results. **Read stacks** are plotted to show the read support of identified miRNAs. **A boxplot** is used to visualize miRNA expression patterns and arm selection events across different samples. **A bipartite network** is constructed to depict miRNA-target interactions predicted by |psRNAtarget| [1]_. Users can quickly browse this miRNA and further decide which features make this miRNA candidate not actually a *bona fide* miRNA.
