MiRNA Compilation
=================

This module generates a comprehensive collection of miRNA candidates by aggregating already annotated miRNAs from four plant miRNA databases (i.e., |miRBase|, |PmiREN|, |sRNAanno|, and |PsRNA|) and predicted miRNAs from user-submitted sRNA-Seq data. Four functions are implemented, including ``miRNARetrival``, ``miRNAPredict``, ``genomeRetrival``, and ``miRNATranslate``. The details are as follows:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users are required to input the SRA accession number or upload compressed raw sequencing data (fq.gz) in ZIP format (see following figure). The example data used in this tutorial are listed in ``sRNA-Seq_test_data.zip``.
