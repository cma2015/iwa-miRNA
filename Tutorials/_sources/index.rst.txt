Welcome to iwa-miRNA's documentation!
=====================================

Brief introduction
--------------------

- MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of short non-coding RNA, play fundamental roles in most biological processes at post-transcriptional level. The annotation of miRNA is of great importance both for supporting research in genome-scale annotation and as a foundation for functional research. 
- We present a web-based platform, iwa-miRNA, to allow generate a comprehensive collection of miRNA candidates, and interrogate miRNA annotation in a straightforward way, without the need for computational skills.
- iwa-miRNA Docker image is available at https://hub.docker.com/r/malab/iwa-mirna. Source codes and user manual are available at https://github.com/cma2015/iwa-miRNA. The web server of iwa-miRNA is accessible at http://iwa-miRNA.omicstudio.cloud.
