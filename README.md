- iwa-miRNA allows users to generate a comprehensive collection of miRNA candidates, and to interrogate miRNA annotation in a straightforward way, without the need for computational skills.

- iwa-miRNA Docker image is available at https://hub.docker.com/r/malab/iwa-mirna. Source codes and user manual are available at https://github.com/cma2015/iwa-miRNA. The web server of iwa-miRNA is accessible at https://deepngs.nwafu.edu.cn (Note: The server was undergoing a temporary power outage (from 6:00 a.m., July 15 to 10:00 a.m., July 16, 2020, Beijing time)).

- The iwa-miRNA is composed with three functional modules: MiRNA Compilation, MiRNA Selection, and Manual Curation. It also provides users with some useful tools for downstream exploratory analysis. More details regarding these functional modules can be found [here](https://github.com/cma2015/iwa-miRNA/blob/master/Tutorials/Modules.md).
