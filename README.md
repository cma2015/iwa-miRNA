# iwa-miRNA

- iwa-miRNA is a Galaxy-based bioinformatics platform for interactively annotating miRNAs from plant genomes. It can be used to generate a comprehensive collection of miRNA candidates, and allows users to interrogate miRNA annotation in a straightforward way, without the need for computational skills.

- The iwa-miRNA project is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/cma2015/iwa-miRNA). A demo server is available at https://deepngs.nwafu.edu.cn. We suggest users to run iwa-miRNA locally using the Docker image (https://hub.docker.com/r/malab/iwa-mirna).
